I am Deborah Moffitt, but I go by Katie.

I've worked for Bridgestone Americas for a total of 18 months as a software engineering co-op and recently as an intern. I gained a lot of experience in full stack web development, database administration, and project management while working there.

I'm from a very small town in middle Tennessee near Fall Creek Falls state park.

 I really like to read, play the piano, paint, and I like to hike when it's not miserable outside.
