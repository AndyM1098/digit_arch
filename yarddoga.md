Hi, I really like crocheting, going to the gym, and playing Yu-Gi-Oh. I have a Interdisciplinary Data Science Major, and, from this class, I would like a better and deeper understanding of how to manage and work with data. I believe this class will teach me how to study data and clean the data in the most effective way.
