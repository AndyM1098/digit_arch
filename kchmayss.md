I am Karim Chmayssani, and I am a senior CS student. I work as an undergrad research assistant with Dr. Santos, and have gotten experience working with medical data through my projects. I hope to learn more about collecting sparse data, filtering out unhelpful data, and other practices to help me in my research.
